# Weather Forecast Clustering
 
## Overview
This repository contains the code for analyzing weather data and visualizing clustering results using the K-Means algorithm. Indonesia, with its diverse climate, relies heavily on accurate weather forecasting for agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. However, understanding weather patterns can be challenging without proper data analysis.

To address this, the study utilizes data sourced from the BMKG Data API to perform weather clustering analysis. By applying the K-Means algorithm, the project identifies distinct weather patterns across various regions, enabling users to make informed decisions based on climate conditions.

## The code in this repository handles:

Data collection from the BMKG Data API.
Preprocessing of weather data for analysis.
Implementation of the K-Means algorithm for clustering.
Visualization of clustering results to aid in understanding weather patterns.
